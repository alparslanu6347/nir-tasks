me and my team have to build a web application based on nginx in three supported versions:
- mainline, which uses nginx version 1.17.9-perl,
- stable, which uses a DEFAULT_NGINX_VERSION variable defined in the .env file,
alpine, which uses nginx version 1.17.9-alpine-perl
My role is to create a single docker-compose.yaml file with configuration for the three services, named exactly the same as the version listed above.
All of them should be built using nginx.Dockerfile with the following content, which is located in the same directory as the docker-compose.yaml file:
ARG NGINX_VERSION
ARG BUILD_FILE
FROM nginx:${NGINX_VERSION}
COPY ${BUILD_FILE} /etc/nginx/conf.d
All images should be built as an app with the supported version as a tag, with the exception of the stable service, which should use a version value tag from DEFAULT_NGINX_VERSION.
The mainline and stable services should use debian.conf as the BUILD_FILE argument, while the alpine file should be named alpine.conf. Both are located in the same directory as docker-compose.yaml.
the build process is executed in the app directory
